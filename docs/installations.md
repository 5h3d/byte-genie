## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your local machine:

2. **Python**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. **Docker**: [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

### Installation

#### Clone the Repository

To get started with the project, first clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/5h3d/byte-genie.git
```

#### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

### Build the Docker Image

Navigate to the backend directory that contains the Dockerfile and build the Docker image:

```sh
docker build -t backend-app .
```

This command creates a Docker image named backend-app.

Run the Docker Container
Once the image is built, run the Docker container with the following command:

```sh
docker run -d --name backend-container -p 8000:8000 backend-app
```

This will start the container in detached mode, map port 8000 of the container to port 8000 on your host machine, and name the container backend-container.

### Access the Application

With the container running, you can access the FastAPI application at http://localhost:8000.

### API Endpoints:

POST /summarize/: Endpoint to receive text and return its summary.

### Stopping the Container

To stop the running container, use the following command:

```sh
docker stop backend-container
```

Removing the Container
If you need to remove the container, use:

```sh

docker rm backend-container
```
